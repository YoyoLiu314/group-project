    "### Introduction\n",
    "To do: \n",
    "- Write a bit about what the data set is (couple sentences about PLAICraft, purpose of the study)\n",
    "- State the question: demand forecasting\n",
    "- Describe the dataset used: sessions AND players\n",
    "\n",
    "New question: predicting subscription status\n",
    "- Use quantitative variables (ignore experience)\n",
    "- Can use age, hours played, number of sessions, and session length: the last two use some more interesting wrangling techniques to figure out that can show our knowledge and make our investigation a bit different\n",
    "- Call it \"playing behaviour\"?"

    "- `subscribe`, whether the player subscribed to a database: logical\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`, a unique, untraceable identifier derived from the player's email: character string\n",
    "- `played_hours`, how long they played PLAICraft, in hours: numeric \n",
